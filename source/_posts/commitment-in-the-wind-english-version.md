<pre id="best-answer-content" data-accusearea="aContent">风中的承诺

昨夜的雨 |Rain of last night
惊醒我沉睡中的梦|Wake up with a start the dream in my soundly asleep
迷惑的心|Heart of confusing
沾满着昨日的伤痛|Being stained with is full distressing of yesterday
冷冷的风 |Chilly breeze
不再有往日的温柔|No longer have the gentleness in the past days
失去的爱 |Love of losing
是否还能够再拥有|Whether can also own again
漫漫长路|Boundless long road
谁能告诉我 |Who can tell me
究竟会有多少错|Actually will have how much wrong
何处是我最终的居留|Where is that I finally stay
曾经在雨中对我说|Once said to me in rain
今生今世相守|The this present life present life mutually guards
曾经在风中对我说 |Once said to me in the breeze
永远不离开我 |Don't leave me forever
多少缠绵编织成的梦|How much tie up Mian to weave of dream
多少爱恨刻划的镜头 |How much love to hate to depict of lens
为何一切到了终究还是空 |Why the whole arrived to finally still get empty

一首充满韵味的歌，百听不厌！</pre>
